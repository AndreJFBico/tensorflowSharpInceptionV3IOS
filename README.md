# TensorflowSharp InceptionV3 experiment

Simple experiment binding tensorflow C api and tensorflow sharp together in a Xamarin iOS project.

We have included a quantized InceptionV3 model and the compiled tensorflow-core and protobuf libraries.

Example runs on Debug mode in the simulator and writes the classification results to the console output.
Not working on device for now.
